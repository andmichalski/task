Main task folder "task"
I have worked on Python 3.6.5. I am working on PyCharm IDE.
Tasks 1 and 3 have no requirements
Task 2 need to install two additional modules
On each task I have worked on diffrent virtualenv.

First task
In folder "mysplit" two files my_split.py and test.py (unit tests for this function).
In file my split function my_split.
In terminal type:
python my_split.py string separator (not neccessary in quotes)
Example: "python my_split.py abc:def:ghij :"
where string is a string object to split and separator is a character which split words


Second task
I have used opencv-python module because it is more lightweight than matplotlib.
In this program we do not need see many plots so matplotlib is no necessary.
Main folder function is "collect_image" folder.
We need have two modules installed: numpy and opencv-python
To install requirements type (ubuntu):
pip install -r requirements.txt

There are few files in folder:
func.py - written functions are here
main.py - main function to execute
test_file.npy - numpy array to mock to speed up unittests
tests.py - unittests for written functions

To execute program please type in terminal:
python main.py url
where url is an address (not neccessary in quotes)
after image is binarized You decide to save or not by click "s" button or any key.
The binarized image is saved in main function folder as "bin_image.jpg"


Third task
Main function folder - "simple_calculator". There are 3 files:
-tests.py - unit tests for this
-server.py - server script
-client.py - client script

To use this scrips You need to type in terminal (in main function folder):
python server.py &<ENTER> - this run server in background
python client.py <ENTER> - this command run client

Now You can type two numbers and mathematical character like "+-*/" other are not accepted.
Server send You response with result. 
To exit server and client please type in client line:
exit
