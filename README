Main task folder "task"
I have worked on Python 3.6.5
Before running programs install requirements.
Example: in ubuntu in main function folder type:
"pip install -r requirements.txt

First task
In folder "mysplit" two files my_split.py and test.py (unit tests for this function).
In file my split function my_split.
In python console type:
from mysplit.my_split import my_split
my_split(string, separator)

where string is a string object to split and separator is a character which split words

Second task
I have used opencv-python module because it is more lightweight than matplotlib.
In this program we do not need see many plots so matplotlib is no necessary.
Main folder function is "collect_image" folder.

There are few files in folder:
func.py - written functions are here
main.py - main function to execute
test_file.npy - numpy array to mock to speed up unittests
tests.py - unittests for written functions

To execute program please type in python console:
from collect_image.main import collect_image
collect_image(url)
where url is an address in python string (have to be in qoutes like "http:......pl")
after image is binarized You decide to save or not by click "s" button or any key.
The binarized image is saved in main function folder as "bin_image.jpg"
